## 🧪 Testing Different Payment Methods

### Test Apple Pay (if on iPhone/Mac)

2. Go through checkout flow
3. Apple Pay button will automatically appear
4. Use a test card in your Apple Wallet

### Test Cash App Pay

3. Click it to test the flow

### Test Card Declines
Use these test cards to simulate different scenarios:

| Card Number         | Description                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Card declined (generic)        |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Insufficient funds             |
| 4000 0000 0000 0069 | Expired card                   |
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Success (always works)         |

## 🔔 Setting Up Webhooks (Important!)

Webhooks tell your backend when subscriptions change (canceled, payment failed, etc.)

### Local Development (using Stripe CLI)

1. **Install Stripe CLI**:
```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
curl -s https://packages.stripe.com/api/v1/buster/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.stripe.com/stripe-cli-debian-local stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stripe.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stripe
```

2. **Login to Stripe CLI**:
```bash
stripe login
```

3. **Forward webhooks to your local backend**:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8001/api/webhooks/stripe
```

4. You'll see: `Your webhook signing secret is whsec_...`
5. Copy this secret and add to `/app/backend/.env`:
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
```

6. Restart backend: `sudo supervisorctl restart backend`

### Production Deployment

When you deploy to production:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → **Developers → Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Enter your production URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Copy the **Signing secret**
6. Add it to your production environment variables

## 💰 Going Live (Production)

Once testing is done and you're ready for real payments:

1. **Complete Stripe account verification**:
   - Business details
   - Bank account for payouts
   - Tax information

2. **Switch to Live Mode**:
   - Toggle from "Test" to "Live" in Stripe Dashboard
   - Get new API keys (will start with `pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`)

3. **Create live products**:
   - Create the same 3 products in Live mode
   - Get new Price IDs

4. **Update production environment**:
   - Use live API keys
   - Use live Price IDs
   - Set up production webhook

5. **Enable payment methods**:
   - Go to **Settings → Payment methods**
   - Enable: Cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Cash App Pay

## 📊 Monitoring Payments

### Stripe Dashboard
View all your payments, subscriptions, and customers at: https://dashboard.stripe.com

### Check Subscriptions in Your Database
```bash
# In your app
curl http://localhost:8001/api/subscription/USER_ID_HERE
```

### Check Webhook Events
All webhook events are logged in MongoDB collection: `webhook_events`

## 🔒 Security Notes

✅ **Already implemented**:
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure API key handling (server-side only)
- No credit card data touches your servers
- PCI compliance handled by Stripe

## 💡 Customer Portal

Users can manage their subscriptions (update card, cancel, view invoices) using Stripe's Customer Portal.

This is already set up! When a user clicks "Manage Subscription" in your dashboard, they'll be redirected to a Stripe-hosted portal.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"
- Make sure you copied the full key (starts with `sk_test_` for secret or `pk_test_` for publishable)
- Make sure you're in Test Mode in Stripe Dashboard
- Restart backend after adding keys

### "No such price"
- Make sure you copied the Price IDs correctly (start with `price_`)
- Make sure products are created in Test Mode
- Check if you're using the right plan ID (1, 2, or 3) from your pricing page

### Webhook not working
- Make sure Stripe CLI is running: `stripe listen`
- Check webhook secret is added to .env
- Backend must be restarted after adding webhook secret
- Check `/var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log` for errors

### Payment succeeded but not showing in dashboard
- Check webhook is working (see above)
- Check MongoDB database: `use nova_squad; db.subscriptions.find()`
- Look for errors in backend logs

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### Test on real devices:
1. Use `ngrok` to expose your local server:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

2. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env` to your ngrok URL

3. Open the ngrok URL on your phone

4. Test Apple Pay (iPhone) or Google Pay (Android)
